# ==============================================================================
# Tock Configuration File
# ==============================================================================
# This file supports two modes:
# 1. CSV Mode: Points to an external CSV file (simplest for weekly schedules).
# 2. Native TOML Mode: Defines the schedule directly here (best for custom cycles).

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTION 1: CSV MODE (Recommended for standard weekly schedules)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If "csv_path" is set, Tock will ignore the rest of this file and load tasks
# from the CSV. Comment this line out to use Option 2.
#
# The path can be absolute or relative to this config file.
# ~ is expanded to your home directory.

# csv_path = "~/Documents/timetables/weekly_schedule.csv"


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTION 2: NATIVE TOML MODE (Complex/Custom Cycles)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Use this section if you want to define your schedule directly in this file,
# or if you have a non-standard cycle (e.g., a 6-day school cycle).

# The length of your cycle in days.
# Default is 7.
cycle_days = 7

date_format = "01/02/2006"
csv_path = "/home/daniel/Documents/School/Timetable.csv"
# Required ONLY if cycle_days is NOT 7.
# This date acts as the "Day 0" for your cycle calculations.
# Format: "YYYY-MM-DD"
# anchor_date = "2025-01-20" 

# --- Defining Days ---
# Each [[day]] block represents a specific day in the cycle.
#
# FOR STANDARD 7-DAY WEEKS (cycle_days = 7, no anchor_date):
#   id = 0 (Sunday)
#   id = 1 (Monday)
#   id = 2 (Tuesday)
#   id = 3 (Wednesday)
#   id = 4 (Thursday)
#   id = 5 (Friday)
#   id = 6 (Saturday)
#
# FOR CUSTOM CYCLES (e.g., cycle_days = 6 with anchor_date):
#   id = 0 (The anchor date, and every 6th day after)
#   id = 1 (The day after anchor, etc.)

# Example: Monday (Standard Week)
[[day]]
id = 1
tasks = [
	{ name = "Morning Standup", start = "09:00", end = "09:30" },
	{ name = "Deep Work", start = "09:30", end = "12:00" },
	{ name = "Lunch Break", start = "12:00", end = "13:00" },
]

# Example: Tuesday (Standard Week)
[[day]]
id = 2
tasks = [
	{ name = "Team Meeting", start = "10:00", end = "11:00" },
	{ name = "Project Dev", start = "11:00", end = "15:00" },
	{ name = "Gym", start = "17:30", end = "18:30" },
]

# Example: Friday (Standard Week)
[[day]]
id = 5
tasks = [{ name = "Wrap-up", start = "16:00", end = "17:00" }]
